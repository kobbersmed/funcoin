        Parameters:
        -----------
        Y_dat: List of length [number of subjects] contatining time series data for each subject. Each element of the list should be array-like of shape (T[i], p), with T[i] the number of time points for subject i and p the number of regions/time series. 
        X_dat: Array-like of shape (n_subjects, q). First column has to be ones (does not work without the intercept).
        max_comps: Maximal number of components (gamma), to be identified. May terminate with fewer components if a singular matrix occurs during the optimisation. This may happen 
                    if the problem is ill-posed, e.g. if no common components can be found or the common directions of variance have already been identified.
        gamma_init: False or array of length n_regions. If not False, the optimization algorithm uses the array as initial condition for gamma. In the optimisation algorithm, beta is determined from the current gamma, 
                    without utilising an initial beta matrix. Default value False.
        rand_init: Boolean. If True, the decomposition will use random initial gamma values. Default value True.
        n_init: Integer. Default value 20. 
        max_iter: Integer>0. Maximal number of iterations when determining gamma (and beta, if betaLinReg is False). Default value 1000.
        tol: Float >0. Maximal tolerance when optimizing for gamma (and beta). If an iteration yields an absolute change smaller than this value in all elements of gamma and beta, the optimisation stops. Default 1e-4.
        trace_sol: Boolean. Whether or not to keep all intermediate steps in the optimization of gamma and beta. The steps are stored in lists in instance variables self.gamma_steps_all and self.beta_steps_all.
        seed_initial: Integer or None. If integer, this seeds the random initial conditions. Default value False.
        betaLinReg: Boolean. If true, the algorithm concludes with performing ordinary linear regression on the transformed values using the gamma transformation found to improve accuracy of beta estimation. Default False.
        overwrite_fit: Boolean. If False: Returns an exception if the class object has already been fitted to data. If True: Fits using the provided data and overwrites any existing values of gamma, beat, dfd_values_training, and logZ_training.

        Returns:
        --------
        self.beta: Array-like of shape (q,n_dir). Coefficients of the log-linear model identified during decomposition.
        self.gamma: Array-like of shape (p,n_dir). Matrix with each column being an identified gamma projection.
        self.dfd_values_training: Array of length n_dir. Contains the average values of "deviation from diagonality" computed on the data used to fit the model. This can be used for selecting the number of projections (see Zhao, Y. et al. (2021)). 
        self.logZ_training: The transformed values of the data used to fit the model, i.e. the logarithm of the diagonal elements of Gamma.T @ Sigma_i @Gamma for subject i.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        gamma_dir: The direction up to which the dfd value is calculated. 
        Y_dat: List of length [number of subjects] contatining time series data for each subject. Each element of the list should be array-like of shape (T[i], p), with T[i] the number of time points for subject i and p the number of regions/time series.
        weighted_io: Boolean or 0/1. If set to True/1, the average dfd value is a weighted average according to the number of time points for each subject. If all subjects have the same number of time points, setting this parameter to 1 can improve estimation by reducing the risk of overflow.
        dfd_aritm: Boolean or 0/1. If set to False/0, the average dfd value is computed as the geometric mean (weighted or unweighted according to the weighted_io parameter). If 1, the arithmetic mean is used. Default value is 0. 
        logtrick_io: Boolean of 0/1. When computing the harmonic mean, a log-transformation is temporarily applied to avoid overflow. Recommended, but can be disabled to test the difference. Default value 1.
